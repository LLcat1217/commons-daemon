Apache Commons Daemon
=====================


Configuring and Building Commons Daemon on Windows
==================================================

Using Visual Studio, you can build the Commons Daemon.
The Makefile make file has a bunch of documentation about its
options, but a trivial build is simply;

  nmake CPU=X86
  nmake CPU=X86 PREFIX=c:\desired\path\of\daemon install


Needed Tools
============

Commons Daemon needs the Microsoft Visual C 6/SP5 to
build the x86 binaries. This is because this compiler
doesn't create MSVCRTnn.DLL dependencies which will
be loaded inside running JVM if used.
For building AMD64/EMT64 binaries use the Platform SDK
for Windows Server 2003R2.

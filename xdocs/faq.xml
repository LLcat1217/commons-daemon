$ sh support/buildconf.sh
autoconf: Undefined macros:
***BUG in Autoconf--please report*** AC_PATH

Your version of autoconf is to old, upgrade your autoconf and retry.
Or run support/buildconf.sh in another machine and copy the daemon tree in
the machine where you want to compile jsvc.

configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
mv: Makefile: set owner/group (was: 1670/0): Operation not permitted
config.status: creating Makedefs
mv: Makedefs: set owner/group (was: 1670/0): Operation not permitted
config.status: creating native/Makefile
mv: native/Makefile: set owner/group (was: 1670/0): Operation not permitted
*** All done ***
Now you can issue "make"

You should ignore those error messages they are normal in FreeBSD.
config.status creates files in /tmp and move them in the current directory.
When FreeBSD creates files it sets the group of the files to
the group of the directory where the files are created.
So if /tmp is group "wheel" the files are "wheel". When moving the files in
the current directory (if you are not member of group "wheel")
the group "wheel" cannot be set on the moved files.
